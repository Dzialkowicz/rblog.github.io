# The Beggining

I will try to explain to myself as a total begginer, what I have done this day to know something more about **modern** web developing process.

## npm

As a start, it is needed to download npm, which is `Node.JS` repository, from where, I will probably download most of the tools.
To do that, simply go to `Node.JS` Page and download zip file and install it somewhere. Best way is to install on `C:/` directory on Windows
(Yes, for now I'll be using Windows because I'm too poor for having a Mac), because I couldn't find a nice way to navigate between partitions
in `cmd`. 

## Redux

I have decided to start on the Roots, so now I am checking **[Redux](http://redux.js.org/)** website. It should take some time before I will get any 
**stable** knowledge from this. 

I have installed needed things from `Read Me` section on this site.
